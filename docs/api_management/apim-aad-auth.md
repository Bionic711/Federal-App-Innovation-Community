# Azure API Management with AAD

[Azure API Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/) is made of up various capabilities to secure, monitor, and govern your organization's APIs and backend services. A key pattern with securing APIs is integrating with Azure Active Directory such that APIs leverage modern authentication protocols like OAuth 2.0.

This video below shows how this works and how you can use APIM to protect APIs without having to do so in the code of your backend API. This can be applied to any sort of API being managed (hosted anywhere or 3rd part SaaS APIs).
